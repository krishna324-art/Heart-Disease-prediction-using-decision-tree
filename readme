 Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree

A simple project that predicts the presence of heart disease using a Decision Tree classifier.

What I did
- Collected and prepared a heart disease dataset (e.g., UCI/Cleveland).
- Performed exploratory data analysis and cleaned/preprocessed the data (missing values, encoding, scaling as needed).
- Trained and tuned a Decision Tree model.
- Evaluated the model with common metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC).
- Saved the trained model and included the code/notebook used for analysis.

# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree

A simple project that predicts the presence of heart disease using a Decision Tree classifier.

What I did
- Collected and prepared a heart disease dataset (e.g., UCI/Cleveland).
- Performed exploratory data analysis and cleaned/preprocessed the data (missing values, encoding, scaling as needed).
- Trained and tuned a Decision Tree model.
- Evaluated the model with common metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC).
- Saved the trained model and included the code/notebook used for analysis.

Files (example)
- `notebook.ipynb` — EDA, preprocessing, training and evaluation steps.
- `train.py` — script to train the model and save the artifact.
- `predict.py` — simple inference script (optional).
- `model.pkl` — saved trained Decision Tree model (if present).
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.

Quick start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the notebook or train script:
   - Notebook: open `notebook.ipynb`
   - Script: `python train.py`
3. Use `predict.py` (or load `model.pkl`) to run predictions on new samples.

Notes
- This project focuses on demonstrating a straightforward Decision Tree approach for heart disease prediction. It is intended as a learning/example project, not a clinical tool.
- Replace dataset and file names below with the actual files in the repository if they differ.

If you want, I can commit this README.md file to your repository — tell me and I'll add it.
